S&M updates:
+Many S&M actions (if not all) run faster
+Added new dockable view "S&M Live Configs" and MIDI CC related actions
This is for live performance: this view allows you configuring up to 8 MIDI CC only actions "Apply live config n (MIDI CC only)".
These actions belong to a new section "S&M Extension". See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=63775|here|.
Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/LiveConfig.gif|here|.
+Build lane actions updated (REQUIRES REAPER v3.66)
- Now, the lanes order ALWAYS match the recording order.
- Now, these actions work with ALL media types (including MIDI in-project ones)
- Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/buildlanes.gif|here|.
Limitation: for the moment, "building lanes" on *imploded* isn't supported, details http://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=577538&postcount=68|here|
Other updates related to takes:
- Added action "SWS/S&M: Takes - Activate lane under mouse cursor"
- v3.66's take colors are now handled
+FX Chain view improvments
- Paste of FX Chains in now possible (only FX Chain replacement was possible until now)
=> added actions:
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste FX chain to selected tracks
=> renamed actions, added "(replace)" to make things clear:
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected items, all takes
SWS/S&M: Paste (replace) FX chain to selected tracks
- External drag'n'drop of FX Chains (e.g. drag from an external explorer, drop into the view)
- Internal drag'n'drop of FX Chains (drag from the view, drop in a track) - WIN ONLY
- Unlimited number of slots
=> added popup items "Add slot", "Insert slot" and "Delete slots"
- Text filter added, demo http://stash.reaper.fm/6083/FXChainFiltering.gif|here|
- Simplified display in the "Path" column (when using REAPER's FX Chains default path)
- Added a column "Description", double-click to enter some text. Note: it's volountary not used when filtering.
- Safer cut/copy/paste actions
- Tweaks
+Added new dockable view "S&M Notes/help" for item notes, track notes and, on Win, custom/online action help (for the action being selected in the "Action" dialog box).
Online help (link to the http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|Action List Reference|): click on the action name.
When enabled, the lock button just allows key stroke to pass through the main window.
S&M Notes/help & S&M Find demo: http://reaper.mj-s.com/notes_and_find.gif|here|.
Added related actions:
- SWS/S&M: Open Notes/help window...
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to action help - WIN ONLY
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to item notes
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to track notes
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Switch to project notes (disable auto updates)
Rmk: due to an API limitation, this is *not* REAPER's project notes though these ones are also saved in RPP files.
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Set action help file...
This action sets the filename where your custom notes about actions will be saved (so that you can have different ones, 
e.g. multi-language). By default this file is set for you, it's S&M_Action_help_en.ini (in REAPER's default resource 
directory, with other ini files). It's where *action* notes are saved, other notes (item, track and project) are saved 
in RPP files.
- SWS/S&M: Notes/help - Toggle lock
+Added new dockable view "S&M Find" (bound to Ctrl-F) with find all, previous & next buttons.
Simple: when something matches, it's selected. The available search scopes are: item names, item names (all takes),
media filenames, media filenames (all takes), item notes, track notes, track names (in case you're drunk) and marker/region names.
+Updated SWS Autocolor view: now also features auto track icon
Added a column "Icon" in the view (right-click in this column or double-click it to set an icon filename) and a tick box "Enable auto icon".
Also added action "SWS/S&M Toggle auto icon enable". BTW, the view has been renamed into "SWS Auto color/icon".
Demo http://reaper.mj-s.com/autoicon.gif|here|.
Rmk: your current color configurations will be preserved when upgrading..
+Added action "Select project (MIDI CC only)", 
Remarks: this action belong to the "S&M section". Learn: absolute CC only. Only the last "stable" CC is processed (i.e. doesn't stuck REAPER).
+Track folders actions
- SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder states
- SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder states
- SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to on
- SWS/S&M: Set selected tracks folder states to off
note: the 2 previous ones are different from native action "Cycle track folder state"
- SWS/S&M: Save selected tracks folder compact states
- SWS/S&M: Restore selected tracks folder compact states
+Arming envelopes actions
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all active envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Arm all active envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Disarm all active envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of volume envelope for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of pan envelope for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of mute envelope for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive volume envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive pan envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all receive mute envelopes for selected tracks
- SWS/S&M: Toggle arming of all plugin envelopes for selected tracks
Remarks:
- these actions only apply for ACTIVE envelopes (i.e. these actions don't create envelopes)
- send envelopes are not (yet) managed, use receive envelopes instead
- as these toggle actions act on several tracks, the reported toggle state is a "best effort" one
+Action List Reference summaries auto generation (Wiki copy/pastable) - Win only
See details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=61929|here|. ALR: http://www.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/Action_List_Reference|here|.
- SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (w/o extensions)
- SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (SWS/Xenakios/S&M extensions only)
- SWS/S&M: Save ALR Wiki summary (FNG extensions only)
+Implemented FRs: 68, 166, 170, part of 19, most part of 105
+Fixes:
Issue 182: fixed strange S&M.ini location on OSX
Issue 172: fixed slow S&M actions with certain plugins and/or massive in-project items. Background effort started a long time ago..
Issue 164: fixed possible crash in reaConsole
Isuue 163: SWS snapshots crash, fix still TBC
Issue 174: S&M paste routing/sends/receives actions only paste to the 1st selected track
Issue 169: deprecated Xen's actions "Delete selected item and source media (immediately!)" (and similar ones)
=> added actions:
- SWS/S&M: Delete selected items' takes and source files (prompt, no undo)
- SWS/S&M: Delete selected items' takes and source files (no undo)
- SWS/S&M: Delete active take and source file in selected items (prompt, no undo)
- SWS/S&M: Delete active take and source file in selected items (no undo)
On Win, source files are moved to the recycle bin.
+Misc updates:
- Better management of the "S&M" ini file
=> The S&M.ini file is now located in REAPER's default resource path (i.e. with other ini files), it was "<REAPER_install_dir>/Plugins/" before
=> This file is moved automatically, your current configurations are kept
- Slight action renaming (mispelling, better display order)
- Tagged some Xen's action as "Deprecated": replaced or overexceeded.

!v1.7.3 #4 (August 29, 2010)
Fixed item fade actions:
- Added new action "SWS: Set item fades to default length"

!v1.7.3 #1 (July 15, 2010)
<b>Requires REAPER v3.651!</b>

S&M updates:
+Added actions:
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Hide all CC lanes
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Create CC lane
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Save displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
- SWS/S&M: Active ME - Set displayed CC lanes, slot <i>n</i> (n: 1..4)
Note: those actions apply to the active MIDI Editor but only belong to the main section of the action list, for the moment. Displayed CC lanes are saved in <my_reaper_dir>/Plugins/S&M.ini
- SWS/S&M: Cycle focused window (win only)
This actions need to be bind with a special modifier in order to pass-thru the main window (example: Ctrl Shift a).
Also, few windows eat keystrokes, it will not work for them (e.g. action list which text filter is focused by default).
- SWS/S&M: Let REAPER breathe
This action only makes sense for corner cases macros (see MIDI Editor example http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=60657|here|)
+Fixes:
- issue 140, part of issue 161
- FX Chain view: fixed "Clear slot" actions

!v1.7.2 #10 (June 14, 2010)
S&M updates:
+All S&M toggle actions now report their toggle states to toolbar buttons and menus
Notes: with a mix of different toggle states (e.g. toggle something for several tracks), the state will be a "best effort" one. Also, native "limitation": button states aren't always refreshed (contray to their tooltips..)
+Updated following actions so that floating FX are hidden when the main window gets the focus
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX for selected tracks (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus previous floating FX (& main window on cycle)
SWS/S&M: Focus next floating FX (& main window on cycle)
+Added actions: alternative to native actions, they split -only- and all selected items, see details http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=51547|here| :
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit cursor (no change selection)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select left)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at time selection (select right)
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor
SWS/S&M: Split selected items at edit or play cursor (ignoring grouping)
SWS/gofer: Split selected items at mouse cursor (obey snapping)
Note: this one is from gofer (REAPER forum member), it was just traduced from Python. Usefull with an armed toolbar button.

All cycle FX focus/float-only actions (corner case issues with the master track)
Some float, unfloat FX actions with multiple track selection

SWS/S&M: Split items at time selection (if exists), else at cursor (MIDI) or at prior zero crossing (audio)
+Action list clean-up (wording updates as proposed in issue 119)

Also, preview actions unmute items as necessary (and restore after preview)

Bugfixes for OSX FX chain copy/paste/float actions.

!v1.6.2 #3 (March 20, 2010)
New stuff from Jeffos, (much was in build #2 as well, #3 adds bugfixes):

Added send/rcv action:
+Remove receives for selected track(s)

Added FX actions: FX selection (!) + some related actions
+Select previous FX (cycling) for selected track(s)
+Select next FX (cycling) for selected track(s)
+Select FX n for selected track(s)
where n is in [1; 8]. Multi-selection not possible (yet?)
+Toggle selected FX online/offline for selected track(s)
+Set selected FX online for selected track(s)
+Set selected FX offline for selected track(s)
+Toggle all FXs (except selected) online/offline for selected track(s)

+Float selected FX window for selected track(s)
+Show FX chain (selected FX) for selected track(s)

Updated FX chain actions:
+32 slots are now available
as there's no related GUI (yet), the only way to access slots from 9 to 32 is to use the new "prompt for slot" actions, see below. New actions "List FX chain slots..." & "Clear FX chain slot..." may help for that too.

Added FX chain actions:
+Copy FX chain from selected track
+Cut FX chain from selected track
+Paste FX chain to selected track(s)
rmk: the FX chain "clipboard" is shared with items, so it's possible to copy/paste from tracks to items and vice-et-versa
+Load/Paste FX chain to selected track(s), prompt for slot
+Load/Paste FX chain to selected item(s), prompt for slot
+Load/Paste FX chain to selected item(s), all takes, prompt for slot
+List FX chain slots...
+Clear FX chain slot...
I added those 2 last actions just as a facility (better than opening <my_reaper_dir>/Plugins/S&M.ini a text editor)

Take actions:
+Comping - Clear active take(s)
this one was added in the previous build, just slightly renamed
+Comping - Build lane(s) for selected track(s)
This actions uses the "Empty takes" Cockos has added recently.
BTW, it's clean and is bring few few overhead in project files.
+Comping - Remove empty take(s) in selected item(s)
+Comping - Move takes up (cycling)
+Comping - Move takes down (cycling)
+Comping - Select lane from selected item
