SWS Extension

The SWS extension is a collection of features that seamlessly integrate into REAPER, the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software by Cockos, Inc.

For more information on the capabilities of the SWS extension or to download it, please visit the end-user website http://www.standingwaterstudios.com/reaper.
For more information on REAPER itself or to download the latest version, go to http://www.reaper.fm.

This extension was built using functionality from the REAPER SDK, available at http://www.reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/plugin.php. The main SDK file (reaper_plugin.h) is included in the source tree with permission, and so download of the SDK is not required unless you would like to see the examples. The secondary SDK file reaper_plugin_functions.h is generated by REAPER itself.
The code is provided here in the hopes that other people add to it, or just learn from the example. You are welcome to contribute.

While not strictly required by the license, if you use the code in your own project we would like definitely like to hear from you.


The SWS extension includes the following 3rd party libraries (which are all similarly licensed):

* OscPkt http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/oscpkt/
* TagLib http://taglib.github.io/
* libebur128 https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128


The SWS extension heavily relies on WDL from Cockos http://www.cockos.com/wdl/
